## (Not)FAQ

### What is fairness?
For fairness in life, search help at the depression church or idk.  
For fairness in the randomizer, the anwser is in the code, like always. It is still pretty bad, but I was in no mood to create a better algorithm yet.  
TLDR: Fairness defines a minimum sum the rolled loadout should have, each item has a value for bots and bugs.  
For higher fairness values the loadout also needs to have ways to deal with heavy enemies and some kind of aoe to be considered fair.

### Why is value X not higher?
Values for the fairness evaluation are just quick estimations made by me.  
I have not played with every stratagem myself and I am biased like everyone.  
If you have a good way to create better values, let me know.  

### Why is the Machine Gun Sentry disabled by default?
Because it is just a worse playing experience then the Gatling Sentry and has no reason to exist in its current state (other then game progression).  
As long as the Machine Gun Sentry is stricly worse and less fun, I will keep it that way.

### Why is there no setting for X?
I could not think of any more good settings for now. If you have additional wishes, let me know.

### Why is there no randomize for other equipment?
Because it is much more work to include them as well. Will it come in the future? Maybe.
